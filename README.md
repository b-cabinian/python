Python code samples:

dijkstra_path_find.py: Given an indexed list of cities and an associated adjacency
matrix, this script uses the dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest 
path between any two cities.

huffman_coding.py: Given a frequency dictionary, this script creates a Huffman tree. 

I also use Python in several of my Project Euler solutions. Please ask if you would like to see any of those solutions!
